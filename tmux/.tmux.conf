#Session Options


# Set the base index from which an unused index should be searched when a new
# window is created. The default is zero.
#set -g base-index index

# Set action on window bell. any means a bell in any window linked to a session
# causes a bell in the current window of that session, none means all bells are

# Set the number of buffers kept for each session; as new buffers are added to
# the top of the stack, old ones are removed from the bottom if necessary to
# maintain this maximum length.
#set -g buffer-limit number

# Set the command used for new windows (if not specified when the window is
# created) to shell-command, which may be any sh(1) command. The default is an
# empty string, which instructs tmux to create a login shell using the value of
# the default-shell option.
#set -g default-command shell-command

# Specify the default shell. This is used as the login shell for new windows
# when the default-command option is set to empty, and must be the full path of
# the executable. When started tmux tries to set a default value from the first
# suitable of the SHELL environment variable, the shell returned by getpwuid(3),
# or /bin/sh. This option should be configured when tmux is used as a login
# shell.
#set -g default-shell path

# Set the default working directory for processes created from keys, or
# interactively from the prompt. The default is empty, which means to use the
# working directory of the shell from which the server was started if it is
# available or the user's home if not.
#set -g default-path path

# Set the default terminal for new windows created in this session - the default
# value of the TERM environment variable. For tmux to work correctly, this must
# be set to 'screen' or a derivative of it.

# Display string to the left of the status bar. string will be passed through

# may contain any of the following special character sequences:
#
#     Character pair    Replaced with

#     #W                Current window name
#     ##                A literal '#'
#
# The #(shell-command) form executes 'shell-command' and inserts the first line
# of its output. Note that shell commands are only executed once at the
# interval specified by the status-interval option: if the status line is
# redrawn in the meantime, the previous result is used. Shell commands are
# executed with the tmux global environment set (see the ENVIRONMENT section).
#
# The window title (#T) is the title set by the program running within the
# window using the OSC title setting sequence, for example:
#
#     $ printf '\033]2;My Title\033\\'
#
# When a window is first created, its title is the hostname.
#
# #[attributes] allows a comma-separated list of attributes to be specified,
# these may be 'fg=colour' to set the foreground colour, 'bg=colour' to set the
# background colour, the name of one of the attributes (see 'attributes' under
# 'Session Options') to turn an attribute on, or an attribute prefixed with 'no'
# to turn one off, for example nobright.
# Examples are:
#
#     #(sysctl vm.loadavg)
#     #[fg=yellow,bold]#(apm -l)%%#[default] [#S]
#
# Where appropriate, special character sequences may be prefixed with a number
# to specify the maximum length, for example '#24T'.
#
# By default, UTF-8 in string is not interpreted, to enable UTF-8, use the
# status-utf8 option.
#set -g status-left string

# set -g status-left-bg blue

# Set the maximum length of the left component of the status bar. The default
# is 10.
#set -g status-left-length length

# Display string to the right of the status bar. By default, the current window
# title in double quotes, the date and the time are shown. As with status-left,
# string will be passed to strftime(3), character pairs are replaced, and UTF-8
# is dependent on the status-utf8 option.
#set -g status-right string

# Set the attribute of the right part of the status line.
#set -g status-right-attr attributes

# Set the foreground colour of the right part of the status line.
#set -g status-right-fg colour

# Set the background colour of the right part of the status line.
# set -g status-right-bg blue

# Contains a list of entries which override terminal descriptions read using
# terminfo(5). string is a comma-separated list of items each a colon-separated
# string made up of a terminal type pattern (matched using fnmatch(3)) and a
# set of name=value entries.
#
# For example, to set the 'clear' terminfo(5) entry to '\e[H\e[2J' for all
# terminal types and the 'dch1' entry to '\e[P' for the 'rxvt' terminal type,
# the option could be set to the string:
#
#     "*:clear=\e[H\e[2J,rxvt:dch1=\e[P"
#
# The terminal entry value is passed through strunvis(3) before interpretation.
# The default value forcibly corrects the 'colors' entry for terminals which
# support 88 or 256 colours:
#
#     "*88col*:colors=88,*256col*:colors=256"
#set -g terminal-overrides string

# Set a space-separated string containing a list of environment variables to be
# copied into the session environment when a new session is created or an
# existing session is attached. Any variables that do not exist in the source

# given to the set-environment command). The default is "DISPLAY WINDOWID
# SSH_ASKPASS SSH_AUTH_SOCK SSH_AGENT_PID SSH_CONNECTION".

# If on, display a status line message when activity occurs in a window for
# which the monitor-activity window option is enabled.

# Like visual-activity, display a message when content is present in a window

#Window Options


# Aggressively resize the chosen window. This means that tmux will resize the
